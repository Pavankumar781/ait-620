Activity 4.01: Car Data Classification

In this activity, you will build a reliable decision tree model that's capable of aiding a company in finding cars that clients are likely to buy. We will be assuming that the car rental agency is focusing on building a lasting relationship with its clients. Your task is to build a decision tree model that classifies cars into one of four categories: unacceptable, acceptable, good, and very good.

Activity 4.02: Random Forest Classification for Your Car Rental Company

In this activity, you will optimize your classifier so that you satisfy your clients more when selecting future cars for your car fleet. We will be performing random forest and extreme random forest classification on the car dealership dataset that you worked on in the previous activity of this chapter.
